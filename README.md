# Getting started

- First thing first go to this [link](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and register yourself for hacktoberfest.

- Now if you already know about github and PR go on skip this step, otherwise visit these link [what is github](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/) and [how to create a pull request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github)

- So now you have registered and learned about github and pr this is what you need to do. You need to submit 4 pull request to any open repository, even yours own repo will count, after your 4 repo wait for 7 days, its the time duration introduced by github this year to validate your pullrequests.

- Also before submitting any pull request to any repository check issues of that repo, this year hacktoberfest is blacklisting repository that just allow user to add its name and other detail and make a pr count.
 Example - [This repo](https://github.com/Dhroov7/Hacktoberfest2019) and it's [issue](https://github.com/Dhroov7/Hacktoberfest2019/issues/270)

 # Code_Of_Conduct 
 - Just like other reporistory

 1. Star this repo if you like ⭐ 
 
 2. Fork 🍽️ this repo top right corner
 
 3. Clone your Repo

 >To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let’s first open up a terminal window.
We’ll use the git clone command along with the URL that points to your fork of the repository.
This URL will be similar to the URL above, except now it will end with .git. In the example above, the URL will look like this:

>https://github.com/your-username/HacktoberFest_2K19.git
You can alternatively copy the URL by using the green “Clone or download” button from your repository page that you just forked from the original repository page. Once you click the button, you’ll be able to copy the URL by clicking the binder button next to the URL:

5. Now that you have made changes run the commands
  >> `git add -A`<br>
  >> `git commit -m "here come you message about the changes"`<br>
  >> `git push origin master`

6. Now as you have learned above [how to create PR](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github) go to you repository and make a pull request and wait for the maintianer to merge your pr. Here you go one pr done.
